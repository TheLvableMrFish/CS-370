CS-370 Week 8 Portfolio Submission
•	Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
I was given the zip file TreausreHuntGame with the files GameExperience.py, TreasureMaze.py, and TreasureHuntGame.ipynb. I contributed code to implement Q-learning to help the agent to learn to follow a maze path correctly and reach a 100%-win rate. This involved creating state values for my win_history, calculating win rate, making sure only valid moves are made, and ect.
•	Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
o	What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
I think they are problem solvers who create solutions.
o	How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I think the first step is addressing it. If it’s an error I find out why it’s happening, where it is coming from, and then plan to solve it. 
o	What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
I think I should act with integrity addressing issues when they come up. I think ethically I am responsible for creating solutions that help solve the users’ needs while also keeping their personal data as reasonably secure as possible.
